## Description

Vendor and Order Tracker is an MVC application to help a bakery owner track the vendors that purchase their goods and the orders belonging to each vendor. For vendors, the bakery owner keeps track of their name, supplies a description and adds orders to the list on their account. Orders consist of a title, description, price and date at minimum.

The homepage consists of a splash page for the app's main function, from which the bakery owner can access the vendors page and view their orders. The vendors page provides a link for creating a new vendor and once filled out, the app reroutes to the vendors page. On each vendor's page is a link to create a new order.

### Under Consideration

- View order page
- Delete vendors, all orders from vendor, individual orders, or all vendors
- Update vendor or order details
- Update paid status of order
- Add search
